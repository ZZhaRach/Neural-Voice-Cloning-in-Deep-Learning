## ECSE FYP: Neural Voice Cloning in Deep Leaarning
This repository is sourced from: [Real-Time-Voice-Cloning]	(https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) and the author only made a few modifications to:
1. Freeze the Synthesizer's encoder for single speaker training
2. Training saving and backup steps
3. Functions to save training loss
4. Adjust the code to adapt the author's computer system and hardware settings

## Additional Dataset
Sinlge speaker dataset that used for fine tuning
Speakers:
1. Darth Vader provided by [dataset_source](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10715-darth-vader-soundboard-star-wars) with audio file transcripts
2. p240 from VCTK dataset obtained from [dataset_source](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/437)

## Trained Model
This repository also contains the pre-trained model and a few trained model from single speaker fine tuning
